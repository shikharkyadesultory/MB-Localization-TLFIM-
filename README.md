Driven and undriven cases of entanglement for angular variation is given in my_module.ipynb

The TEBD -DMRG file written has a energy vs bond dimension plot and there is another one rpeated with the same pattern but for entropy vs bond-dimension hence must be ignored
The TEBD and DMRG code are written in julia hence to be worked only with a julia kernel


Plots for TEBD and DMRG can be visualized when opened in Google Colab
it consists of calculation of ground state energies through imaginary time evolution using TEBD
<br>

The my module code includes for entenglement steering and properties unleashed as a part of driven dynamics
my_module.py conssits of the TEBD calculation of for Transverse and longitudinal field ising model and calculation of entanglement entropy in the case 11 different site length reinforcing the fact of eigenstate thermalization
