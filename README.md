The iTEBD and DMRG code are written in julia hence to be worked only with a julia kernel
Plots for iTEBD and DMRG can be visualized when opened in Google Colab
it consists of calculation of ground state energies through imaginary time evolution using TEBD
<br>
The my module code includes for entenglement steering and properties unleashed as a part of driven dynamics
my_module.py conssits of the TEBD calculation of for Transverse and longitudinal field ising model and calculation of entanglement entropy in the case 11 different site length reinforcing the fact of eigenstate thermalization
